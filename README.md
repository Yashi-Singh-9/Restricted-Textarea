## Overview
The **Restricted Textarea** is a minimalistic project designed to restrict the number of characters a user can input in a `textarea` field. It provides real-time feedback on the number of characters entered and changes the styling when the character limit is reached.

This project can be useful for forms where user input needs to be constrained to a specific length, such as tweet-like input boxes, feedback forms, etc.

Visit the project page on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/restricted-textarea).

## Features
- Character limit enforced on a textarea (default: 250 characters).
- Real-time character counter.
- Visual feedback when the character limit is reached.
- Customizable with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
